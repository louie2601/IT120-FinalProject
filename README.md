# IT120-FinalProject

Project Name: Draco Lens- Dragonfly Identifier
###########################################################################################################################################################################################

Project Overview
The Dragonfly ID app is built using Flutter, which allows it to run seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.
At its core, the application utilizes a TensorFlow Lite machine learning model that has been specifically trained to recognize 10 different dragonfly species.


The app offers two primary ways to identify dragonflies:

By capturing photos directly through the device's camera
By selecting existing photos from the device's gallery

Key Features
Let me walk you through the main features of the Dragonfly ID application:

1. Real-time Camera Identification
Users can point their device's camera at a dragonfly, and the app will provide instant identification along with a confidence score indicating the model's certainty.
2. Gallery Photo Analysis
For dragonflies that have already been photographed, users can select images from their device's gallery for analysis.
3. Comprehensive Species Database

The app can identify 10 different dragonfly species:
Common Green Darner
Blue Dasher
Scarlet Skimmer
Golden-ringed Dragonfly
Widow Skimmer
Emperor Dragonfly
Brown Hawker
Red-veined Darter
Violet Dropwing
Twelve-spotted Skimmer

4. Sighting History & Statistics
All identifications are saved in a history log, allowing users to track their discoveries over time.
The app also provides interesting statistics about their sightings, including total identifications and average confidence scores.

6. Educational Resources
The app includes a guide to all supported dragonfly species, providing users with additional information about each species they encounter.

Technical Implementation

On the technical side, the application uses:

Flutter framework for cross-platform compatibility
TensorFlow Lite for on-device machine learning inference
Camera and image picker plugins for photo capture and selection
Firebase integration for potential data synchronization
Google Fonts for a clean, modern UI
The machine learning model is a quantized TensorFlow Lite model stored locally on the device, ensuring that identifications can be made even without an internet connection.

User Experience

The user interface has been designed with simplicity and usability in mind. The app features:

A dark theme that's easy on the eyes during outdoor use
Intuitive navigation with a bottom menu bar
Clear visualization of identification results with confidence indicators
Responsive design that works well on various screen sizes

Demo Walkthrough
Let me demonstrate how the app works:

On the home screen, users can see an overview of the app's features and access quick actions
The camera screen features a targeting reticle to help frame the shot
After capturing or selecting an image, the app displays the identified species and confidence level
Users can view detailed information about each identification in their history
The guide section provides information about all supported species

Potential Applications
This application serves multiple audiences:

Nature enthusiasts and amateur entomologists who want to learn more about dragonflies
Environmental researchers conducting population studies
Educators teaching students about local biodiversity
Citizen scientists contributing to ecological research

Future Enhancements
Looking ahead, we're considering several enhancements:

Expanding the model to recognize additional species
Adding geolocation tagging to sightings
Implementing offline maps to show sighting locations
Integrating with community science platforms for data sharing
Adding augmented reality features for enhanced user engagement

Conclusion
In conclusion, the Dragonfly ID project demonstrates how mobile technology and machine learning can work together to promote environmental awareness and education.
By making species identification accessible to everyone, we hope to inspire greater appreciation for these remarkable insects and contribute to conservation efforts.
Thank you for your attention. I'm happy to answer any questions you might have about the project.
